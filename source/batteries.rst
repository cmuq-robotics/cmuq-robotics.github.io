Recharging the Robot Batteries
===============================

LiPo Battery Guide (adapted from [trossen]_)
---------------------------------------------

Before you use or charge any lithium battery you must read the `Lithium Battery Saftety Instructions and Warnings <http://trossenrobotics.com/shared/productdocs/lipoWarningGuide.pdf>`_ document.

Do not charge or use batteries if the battery ...

- is punctured or damaged
- is bloated, expanded, swelling or otherwise deformed
- has any cell with a voltage of 3.3v. This means less than 9.9v for a 3-cell/11.1v battery.
- **Do not charge batteries unattended**. Monitor batteries during charging for popping, hissing, smoke, sparks or fire. Also monitor the battery for any swelling or other deformities. Disconnect the battery from your charger immediately.
- Do not charge batteries near flammable material.
- Do not charge batteries while they are in your robot.
